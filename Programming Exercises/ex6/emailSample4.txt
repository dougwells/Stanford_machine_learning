Hi Doug,

I had a crazy end of week!  We had a 55th anniversary surprise party for my parents yesterday.  We had out of town guests arriving the day before.  Lot’s of fun, but I’ve been running non-stop!  Feels good to sit down and get caught up on things.

I miss our chats too!  I was hoping we were going to get to see you guys here in June, but it doesn’t look like that’s going to happen.  We may have to do more deliberative planning rather than try to tack a visit onto something else!

I really don’t have any knowledge of or experience with the type of software you describe.  Sorry I can’t be of much help to your friend.

Nice to hear all the good news on the Wells front.  I’m so happy for Linda’s success too!  Sounds like each of you are in a really good place.

Our crew is having its ups and downs.  Jenny was handling all the added burdens of junior year until we hit spring break.  We canceled all our college tours so she could get her tonsils removed and she’s had a very difficult recovery.  So now she’s feeling behind on everything.  Amanda is loving life at UD and surprised us by deciding she wants to do environmental engineering.  (She was the only one who never showed any interest in engineering!)  Ryan did not go back to Lehigh this semester.  Long story, but he is at home (taking a couple courses at UD and working part time for DeNovix) dealing with multiple issues including narcolepsy and depression.  Fred has settled into a nice routine with DeNovix.  I’m still putzing around with my fingers in multiple pots.  Most of my time these days is going into a local non-profit where I’m going up a steep learning curve on sustainable agriculture.  Lots of fun!

Hope we can schedule a visit sometime soon!
